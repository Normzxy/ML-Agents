A simple project demonstrating the operation of the [ML-Agents tool](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ml-agents), available as an extension to the Unity engine. Two artificial intelligence agents are present on stage, learning through a system of rewards and punishments. One of them acts as a predator and tries to catch the other, while the other learns to get food and avoid the predator. The results of the experiment depend on the mechanics introduced, the type of penalties and rewards imposed (e.g. penalty for hitting a wall, penalty for meeting a predator, reward for catching an agent) and the specific values assigned to the penalties and rewards. The project provides a good starting point for any further modifications.
